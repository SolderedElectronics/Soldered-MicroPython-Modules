# BRIEF:  An example showing how to get the distance value for the Qwiic version of
#         the obstacle sensor breakout board

from ObstacleSensor import ObstacleSensor #Import the obstacle sensor class
import time #Module used to pause the board
from machine import I2C, Pin

#Create an instance of the obstacle sensor object
sensor=ObstacleSensor()

#You can also define a custom I2C communication and address if needed:
#i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(22), sda=Pin(21))
#sensor=ObstacleSensor(i2c, address=0x32)

#Infinite loop
while 1:
    #Print the analog voltage read from the sensor
    print(sensor.analogRead())
    #Pause for 100ms
    time.sleep(0.1)
