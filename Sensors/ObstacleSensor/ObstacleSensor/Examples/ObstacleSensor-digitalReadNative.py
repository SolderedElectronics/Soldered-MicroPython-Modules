# BRIEF:  An example showing us the digital read function of the module to
#         detect an obstacle

from ObstacleSensor import ObstacleSensor #Import the obstacle sensor class
import time #Module used to pause the board

#Create an instance of the obstacle sensor object
sensor=ObstacleSensor(digital_pin=27)

#Note: The digital pin will go to a HIGH state when the voltage it detects is below a certain treshold,
#      that treshold can be configured via the onboard potentiometer

#Infinite loop
while 1:
    #Check if the digital pin is set to HIGH, which means an obstacle is detected
    if sensor.digitalRead():
        print("Obstacle detected!")
    #Pause for 100ms
    time.sleep(0.1)
